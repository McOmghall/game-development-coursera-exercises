A bullet hell game for PC/MAC/Linux, on 3D browser engines.

Introduction
-----

A Fireball for your Friends (hereafter AFfyF) is a skill-focused bullet hell game where you play as a wizard who can only cast different types of fireballs. AFfyF is thought as a mixture of ideas from the bullet hell genre (Touhou, Gradius,...) where you have to detect bullet patterns to best avoid being hit with the controls of a birds-eye-view camera skill-based action RPG (The Legend of Zelda series, Diablo but with more direct controls,...). As the game title suggest this is a story of vengeance where the player needs to throw fireballs to who allegedly were her friends. As the main driver of the idea the main character, the Mage, is thrown in a magical labyrinth. To escape said labyrinth our main character has to destroy 3 powerful enemies, the Bosses, each with its unique attack patterns and skills.

The game drops you into the action immediately surrounding you with attacking enemies from the first second. Therefore you need to learn quickly to survive long enough to beat the game's Bosses, your Friends, that like the traditional bullet hell games are much bigger, much stronger and with a higher number of bullet patterns than the typical mob. A combo system for fireballs is included, meaning each successful hit fills both a random power-up generator for your fireballs and a explosive special fireball that can clear zones of enemies quickly.

How to play
-----

You see your mage from above all the time, and the camera moves a bit following the main crosshair which is controlled with the mouse, to allow you to control the direction your mage is facing and to be able to see more what's ahead of you and less what's behind you giving the opportunity to create tension attacking the main character from unexpected directions. 

WASD or the main cross-pad of the controller move the character in the traditional 8 directions (up, down, left, right and 2-combinations of them) relative to the camera, the M1 (mouse main button) or the main fire button allow to fire normal fireballs that can have power-ups, and M2 (mouse secondary button) allow you to fire an special explosive fireball that makes a lot of damage in an area.

The mage can resist 5 enemy attacks before diying.

###Combos and Power-ups###

Each successful attack on an enemy fills up a combo bar in the following manner: (TBD)

For each of the main points of the combo bar you'll receive, randomely with the given probabilty, the following power ups (TBD):

###Enemies and bosses###

(TBD)

###Level generation###

The magical labyrinth is generated as a plattform without walls, so you can fall to your death from it, that extends whatever the direction the player moves to. To give the player a sense of progress experimentation with the Boss generation times or the level structure is needed. The following ideas are to be tested:

- A number of mobs is required for each Boss to appear, in order of increasing Boss difficulty
- The level expands as a closed plattform that has floors, generating upward stairs from time to time so the player can ascend. Bosses appear in given levels with an easily learnable pattern like (3, 6, 9) or (5, 10, 20).
